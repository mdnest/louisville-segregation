# louisville-segregation

This project was completed at University of Louisville in Fall 2018 semester for Math 560 Statistical Data Analysis. It was submitted to the USCLAP undergraduate statistics competition. The project uses census data to measure correlation between racial proportions by census tracts with socioeconomic variables. It is inspired by the work of Joshua Poe which compares modern socioeconomic maps of Louisville to old Redlining maps.
